With **zero external dependencies** module provides:

- `assert` (72 hand-picked assertion functions), `mock` and `mocker` packages.
- Golden file testing helpers in `goldy` package.
- Assortment of helpers in `kit` package. 
- Configurable any type string dumper in `dunmp` package.
- Build your own assertions with ease using `check` package.
- Test your test helpers with `tester` package.

# Goal

Provide a comprehensive suite of tools designed to make testing more efficient, 
enjoyable to write, and integral to the development process.

Whether you're a seasoned tester or just starting out, tools in this module are 
being crafted to meet your needs, providing a solid foundation for ensuring 
code reliability in projects of all sizes.

## Simplicity and Usability

At the heart of the module lies a commitment to minimalism and an exceptional
developer experience (DX). By maintaining zero external dependencies, the
framework stays lightweight and fast, free from the potential complexities and
conflicts that third-party modules can introduce. Our documentation is being
carefully designed to be thorough, clear, and packed with practical examples,
empowering you to master the module with ease. Expect a great DX with features 
like a fluent, chainable API, descriptive error messages for quick debugging, 
all tailored to streamline your testing workflow.

## Modular and Extensible Design

The `testing` module is built as a collection of modular, laser-focused
packages, each targeting a specific aspect of testing. For instance, you might
leverage the `assert` package for assertions, the `mock` and `mocker` packages
for test doubles, or the `tstkit` package to keep your tests readable and
minimalistic. The modularity lets you customize your testing setup to fit your
project’s exact needs, avoiding unnecessary overhead. Beyond customization, the 
extensible architecture invites you to create your own test helpers ensuring.

## Installation
To install CTX42 Testing Module, use go get:

```shell
go get github.com/ctx42/testing
```

This will make all the package modules available to you.

## Packages

### Main Packages

Packages used in test cases. 

- Package [assert](pkg/assert/README.md) provides assertion toolkit.
- Package [check](pkg/check/README.md) provides equality toolkit used by `assert` package.
- Package [goldy](pkg/goldy/README.md) provides basic golden file support.
- Package [kit](pkg/kit/README.md) provides all sorts of test helpers that are not assertions.
- Package [mock](pkg/mock/README.md) provides primitives for writing interface mocks.
- Package [mocker](pkg/mocker/README.md) provides an interface mock generator.
- Package [must](pkg/must/README.md) provide basic test helpers which panic on error.

### Supporting Packets

Packages are used to create custom checks, assertions, and helpers.

- Package [dump](pkg/dump/README.md) provides a configurable renderer of any type to a string.
- Package [notice](pkg/notice/README.md) helps to create nicely formated assertion messages.
- Package [tester](pkg/tester/README.md) provides facilities to test `Test Helpers`.
